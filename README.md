# Xiphos

### Overview

Xiphos is a classical alpha-beta chess engine with a handcrafted evaluation function.
The project is inspired by Garry Kasparov's "[Deep Thinking](http://www.kasparov.com/deep-thinking-ai)". This fantastic book has evoked my childhood passion, computer chess. I was wondering how hard it could be to develop an engine strong enough to surpass the legendary Deep Blue, so I gave it a try.

The latest release, including the binaries for various platforms, can be found [here](https://github.com/milostatarevic/xiphos/releases).

### Performance

CCRL 40/15: 3300+ ELO (4CPU), peak ranking [5th](https://web.archive.org/web/20191207183101/https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/) (Dec 2019)
